## Executive Summary

QuizZum is an AI-powered learning tool designed to alleviate student overwhelm and cognitive overload when processing complex academic material. It achieves this by providing a frictionless platform to transform lecture notes (text or PDF) into structured, digestible multi-level summaries (easy, medium, hard) and adaptive quizzes that target weak spots. Its core differentiators include a radical focus on simplicity, an active and "playable" learning experience, and hierarchical, adaptive content. This tool aims to make learning more efficient, engaging, and less daunting for students.
