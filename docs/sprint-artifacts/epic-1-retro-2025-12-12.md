## 1. Epic Summary & Metrics

*   **Epic:** Epic 1: Foundation & Core Content Input
*   **Status:** Complete
*   **Stories Completed:** 5/5 (100%)
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   Functional project structure with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend.
    *   Dockerized local development environment.
    *   Core backend API for text and PDF content ingestion with a PostgreSQL database via Prisma.
    *   Functional frontend UI for text and PDF input.
    *   Established E2E and component testing foundation.

## 2. Retrospective Discussion Summary

### What Went Well (Successes)

*   **Resilience & Troubleshooting:** The team demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, successfully navigating complex technical blockers. Key successes include resolving the Prisma client generation issues within Docker and debugging the `pytest-asyncio` event loop conflicts. This shows the team's ability to overcome significant technical hurdles.
*   **Solid Foundation:** The epic delivered a robust and scalable application foundation. The clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend, combined with a containerized environment, sets the project up for future success.
*   **Effective Testing:** The investment in testing paid off. Integration tests were crucial for validating the backend's database logic, and the E2E tests, once configured, provided reliable verification of UI responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.

### Challenges & Opportunities for Improvement

*   **Environment & Configuration Friction:** A significant portion of development time was consumed by initial environment setup and tool configuration. This included issues with Tailwind CSS versions and the complexities of running Prisma within a Docker container.
*   **Implicit Knowledge:** Critical solutions and configurations (e.g., the working Dockerfile commands for Prisma, the correct async test fixture setup) were discovered through trial and error but not immediately documented, creating a risk of knowledge loss or future rework.

## 3. Action Items & Commitments

Based on the discussion, the team commits to the following action items to be completed before the start of Epic 2.

### Process Improvements
1.  **Create "New Story Kickoff Checklist"**: A checklist will be added to the project documentation (`docs/guides/`) to ensure verification of tool versions, configurations, and environment prerequisites before starting a new story.
    *   **Owner:** Bob (Scrum Master)
    *   **Timeline:** Before Epic 2 kickoff.

### Documentation
2.  **Document Backend Setup Guide**: A new guide (`docs/guides/backend-setup.md`) will be created to document the final, working steps for configuring the Prisma and Docker environment, including Dockerfile commands and solutions to the pathing issues encountered.
    *   **Owner:** Charlie (Senior Dev)
    *   **Timeline:** Before Epic 2 kickoff.

## 4. Next Epic Preview & Readiness

*   **Next Epic:** Epic 2: Multi-level Summarization.
*   **Dependencies:** This epic is critically dependent on the stable backend API for content ingestion created in Epic 1.
*   **Readiness:** With the completion of Epic 1 and the commitment to the action items above, the team is **READY** to begin preparation for Epic 2. The action items directly address the main risks and friction points identified in this retrospective.
