# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** December 1, 2025
**Facilitator:** Mary, Business Analyst
**Participant:** User

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** An AI-tool that lets students paste lecture notes and get a summary, quizzes with questions and answers, and topic-lists with explanations. Multi-level summaries and quizzes.

**Session Goals:** To create an app that helps students learn more structured and in a fun way.

**Techniques Used:** Reversal/Inversion, Role Playing, Resource Constraints

**Total Ideas Generated:** Multiple ideas generated and categorized across various aspects of the AI learning tool, from core principles to specific features and an MVP.

### Key Themes Identified:

*   **Simplicity & Focus:** Overcoming "noise" and cognitive overload for students.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Customizing content and challenges based on user needs and performance.
*   **Engagement & Gamification:** Making learning "fun to play with" for daily use.
*   **Accessibility:** Providing explanations suitable for all levels of understanding, including struggling students.

## Technique Sessions

### Reversal/Inversion - Duration: ~15 min

**Description:** Exploring the opposite of desired outcomes to highlight core requirements. We asked: "How could we design an AI tool that makes learning *less* structured and *less* fun?"

**Ideas Generated:**
1.  Too much noise in the app.
2.  Too many choices to make it work.
3.  Ends up being just another app that needs attention.
4.  Boring, repetitive, static tests.

**Insights Discovered:**
*   The app must be radically simple, focused, and intuitive.
*   It needs a frictionless, intuitive user experience.
*   Minimize choices and "noise" while providing powerful features.
*   Transform quizzes and drills from chores into "playable" experiences.

### Role Playing (Overwhelmed Student) - Duration: ~20 min

**Description:** Brainstorming from the perspective of a specific user persona (a busy, slightly overwhelmed student who tends to procrastinate).

**Ideas Generated:**
1.  The app collects the most important information.
2.  Describes information in an easy manner that even a way-behind student can understand.
3.  Quiz difficulty can be set to easy at first, then made more difficult.
4.  Use analogies, provide multiple explanation levels, and focus on foundational concepts.
5.  Overall-level on the progress for each level/topic.

**Insights Discovered:**
*   Immediate, digestible core information, explained simply, is paramount.
*   Powerful ability to simplify complex topics without losing accuracy is essential.
*   Adaptive difficulty directly addresses confidence-building and progression.
*   Hierarchical summaries (multiple explanation levels, analogies, foundational concepts) are crucial.
*   Progress tracking at different levels of topic mastery creates a clear learning roadmap.

### Resource Constraints (MVP Identification) - Duration: ~10 min

**Description:** Identifying the single most critical feature under extreme time and resource limitations (build and launch in 48 hours, one core feature).

**Ideas Generated:**
1.  Multi-level summary is the most valuable core feature.
2.  MVP should have 3 levels: easy, medium, hard for summaries.
3.  UI includes one button for uploading, a choice for level, and a generate-button.
4.  Input can be pasted text or PDF upload.

**Insights Discovered:**
*   The multi-level summary directly addresses the core need to quickly grasp and navigate complex lecture notes.
*   A concise MVP can deliver immediate, high value.
*   Clear and simple UI is critical for the MVP's usability.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

*   **Multi-level Summary MVP**
    *   Description: A core feature providing 3 levels (easy, medium, hard) of summaries.
    *   Why immediate: Addresses core need to quickly grasp and navigate complex notes; achievable MVP.
    *   Resources needed: Single page with text/PDF upload, level choice, generate button.

### Future Innovations

*   **Adaptive Quizzes**
    *   Description: Full quiz system (MCQ, 20 questions) with logic to drill on incorrect answers, adaptive difficulty.
    *   Development needed: Integration of adaptive learning algorithms, question generation, and user progress tracking.
    *   Timeline estimate: Medium-term (after MVP).
*   **Granular Progress Tracking**
    *   Description: Visual progress bars for each topic and each *level* within a topic, showing mastery (e.g., Foundational, Advanced).
    *   Development needed: UI/UX for progress visualization, backend for tracking complex mastery levels.
    *   Timeline estimate: Medium-term (post-MVP).

### Moonshots
*(No distinct moonshot ideas emerged during this session, as the focus remained practical and user-centric.)*

### Insights & Learnings

*   **Overall Goal:** An app that helps students learn more structured and in a fun way.
*   **Central Principle:** Must be radically simple, focused, and intuitive; a "zero-noise" and "frictionless" experience.
*   **User Experience:** Should be "smooth and fun to play with" for daily use.
*   **Accessibility:** Content should be described in an easy manner, understandable by a "way-behind" student (leveraging analogies, foundational concepts, and multiple explanation levels).

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#1 Priority: **Multi-level Summary MVP**
*   Rationale: Provides immediate core value, directly addresses student's primary pain point (digesting complex notes), and is achievable as a first release.
*   Next steps: Begin detailed design and development of the MVP feature set.
*   Resources needed: Focus on AI model integration for multi-level summarization, simple front-end for input/output.
*   Timeline: Short-term (target for initial release).

#2 Priority: **Adaptive Quizzes**
*   Rationale: Key for reinforcing learning, active recall, and personalized study paths. Essential for making the app "fun and structured."
*   Next steps: Research and design adaptive questioning logic, develop quiz UI, integrate with content.
*   Resources needed: AI for question generation (if automated), database for tracking performance.
*   Timeline: Medium-term (post-MVP).

#3 Priority: **Granular Progress Tracking**
*   Rationale: Visualizing mastery and weak spots is highly motivating and provides a structured learning path. Enhances engagement and user retention.
*   Next steps: Design UI for progress visualization, define mastery criteria for topics/levels, integrate with quiz results.
*   Resources needed: UI/UX design, backend for data storage and analysis.
*   Timeline: Medium-term (post-MVP).

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
*   The "Reversal/Inversion" technique effectively highlighted core design principles by exploring negative outcomes.
*   "Role Playing" provided empathetic insights into a specific user's urgent needs.
*   "Resource Constraints" was excellent for pinpointing the most critical, high-value MVP feature.
*   The interactive, step-by-step facilitation kept the session focused and productive.

### Areas for Further Exploration
*   Detailed UI/UX design for the multi-level summary (e.g., how do levels collapse/expand visually?).
*   Specific gamification elements beyond progress bars (e.g., badges, points, streaks).
*   Technical feasibility assessment of AI models for multi-level summarization and adaptive question generation.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
*   **User Story Mapping:** To detail specific user journeys for the MVP and future features.
*   **SCAMPER Method:** To further innovate on existing ideas or pivot for new ones.

### Questions That Emerged
*   What specific AI models will be used for summarization and question generation?
*   How will "difficulty" be defined and controlled for both summaries and quizzes?
*   What is the target platform for the initial MVP?
