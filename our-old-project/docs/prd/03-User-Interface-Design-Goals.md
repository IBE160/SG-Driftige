## User Interface Design Goals
### Overall UX Vision
To provide a radically simple, intuitive, and engaging platform that minimizes "noise" and complex choices, making studying a "fun to play with" experience. The user experience should feel frictionless and adaptive to individual learning paces, fostering structured and effective learning.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
The core interaction will be a clear, two-column layout (stacking on mobile) for text input and summary output. Users will paste text, select a summary level via toggles/radio buttons, click "Generate," and then navigate between pre-generated summaries using tabs. Loading states will provide clear feedback.

### Core Screens and Views
*   **Main Screen - Initial State:** Contains text input area, summary level selector, and a "Generate Summary" button. Output area shows a placeholder.
*   **Main Screen - Loading State:** Input controls disabled, output area shows a loading indicator.
*   **Main Screen - Summary Display State:** Input controls re-enabled, output area displays summaries with tabs for easy switching between Easy, Medium, and Hard.

### Accessibility: None
*(Assumption: For the MVP, explicit WCAG compliance is not a primary focus, but basic usability should still be considered. User can specify if a higher level of accessibility is required.)*

### Branding
Application Title: QuizZum

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The primary focus is a web application accessible via modern desktop and mobile browsers, with basic mobile responsiveness.
