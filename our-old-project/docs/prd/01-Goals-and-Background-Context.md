### Background Context
Students frequently face significant challenges managing and comprehending large volumes of lecture notes, leading to cognitive overload, inefficient study habits, and reduced engagement. This project aims to address this problem by developing an AI-powered learning tool, "QuizZum," which transforms raw lecture notes into structured, digestible, and interactive learning experiences. The primary value proposition is a radically simple, intuitive, and engaging platform offering multi-level summaries, making studying more effective and enjoyable for students who struggle with unstructured learning or procrastination.
