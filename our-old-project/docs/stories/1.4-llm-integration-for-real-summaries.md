# Story 1.4 LLM Integration for Real Summaries

## Epic: Foundation & Core Summarization MVP

## Story Details

As a developer,
I want to integrate a real LLM into the backend,
so that the application can generate actual multi-level summaries.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The backend connects to a chosen LLM API (e.g., Google Gemini).
2.  The backend constructs appropriate prompts for "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard" summaries.
3.  The LLM generates summaries for all three levels based on the input text.
4.  The `/api/summarize` endpoint returns the actual generated summaries.
5.  Error handling for LLM API calls is implemented (e.g., handling API rate limits, connection errors).

## Next Steps

This story is ready for implementation by the Dev Agent.
