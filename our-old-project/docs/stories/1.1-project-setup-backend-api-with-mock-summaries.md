# Story 1.1 Project Setup & Backend API with Mock Summaries

## Epic: Foundation & Core Summarization MVP

## Story Details

As a developer,
I want to set up the basic project structure and a functional backend API,
so that the frontend development can proceed with a stable API to consume.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The backend FastAPI application is running.
2.  The `/api/summarize` endpoint is implemented and accessible.
3.  The `/api/summarize` endpoint accepts a JSON payload with a `text` field (string).
4.  The `/api/summarize` endpoint returns a JSON response containing mock `easy`, `medium`, and `hard` summaries after a simulated delay.
5.  CORS headers are configured to allow requests from the frontend.

## Next Steps

This story is ready for implementation by the Dev Agent.
