### Architect Prompt
@architect Based on this UI/UX Specification and the Product Requirements Document (`docs/prd.md`), please create the `fullstack-architecture.md` document. This document should outline the API specifications, data structures, and the concrete integration strategy with the selected LLM, and save it to `docs/fullstack-architecture.md`. Your architecture should support the specified UX goals and functional/non-functional requirements, considering the monorepo structure and chosen technologies (React, FastAPI).
