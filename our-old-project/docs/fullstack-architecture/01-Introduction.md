## Introduction
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for QuizZum, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

**Note on Phased Development and Early Implementations:**
While this architecture document details a phased project roadmap, particularly focusing on the MVP, it's possible for the codebase to include foundational elements or exploratory prototypes for future epics (e.g., user accounts, quizzes, PDF upload). These early implementations are for technical investigation or groundwork and are explicitly considered out of scope for the immediate MVP delivery, ensuring focus on core functionalities.

### Starter Template or Existing Project
N/A - Greenfield project with pre-scaffolded frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) directories. This document defines the architectural approach for integrating and building upon these foundations.
